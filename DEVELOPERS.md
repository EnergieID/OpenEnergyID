# Development Environment Setup

This guide outlines the setup process for our development environment, focusing on packaging and dependency management.
## Info on dev setup
### Commit practices (pre-commit)
we use [pre-commit ](https://pre-commit.com/)to run RUFF. 
### Poetry for Packaging and Dependency Management

We use [Poetry](https://python-poetry.org/docs/main/#installation) as our primary tool for packaging and managing dependencies. Poetry provides a simple yet powerful way to manage project dependencies and publish packages.

For the most detailed and up-to-date information, please refer to the [official Poetry üìö](https://python-poetry.org/docs/main/#installation).

### Installing Python CLI Applications Globally with pipx

To ensure that Python CLI applications are installed globally on your system while being isolated in their own virtual environments, we utilize `pipx`.

## Steps to Install pipx and Poetry

1. First, [install pipx](https://pipx.pypa.io/stable/installation/) following the instructions on the official website.
2. Once pipx is installed, you can easily install Poetry by running the following command in your terminal:
        ```pipx install poetry```
3. (*optional*) [install](vscode:extension/zeshuaro.vscode-python-poetry) vscode extension for poetry
### Setup with Poetry
```shell
poetry install
```
### publishing with poetry
https://python-poetry.org/docs/repositories/
## Remarks for devcontainer

You can also work inside a docker container(devcontainer).  
To make sure you have access/permissions inside the devcontainer.
From inside the devcontainer after launch, check user and take ownership:

```bash
whoami
sudo chown -R $USER:$USER /workspaces/ -R
```

other option is to run as root from within the `devcontainer.json` `"remoteUser": "root"`

# Useful commands for dev work

```pipx run vulture . --exclude venv```

[deptry](https://github.com/fpgmaas/deptry) for checking dependencies   
```pipx run deptry . --ignore-notebooks```
